# HospitalCRM System Analysis and Modeling

This project involves the analysis of requirements and UML-based modeling of the HospitalCRM system using the RM2PT tool.

## Introduction

The objectives of this project are:
- To understand and apply requirements analysis techniques.
- To develop proficiency in UML modeling methodologies.
- To utilize RM2PT for generating interactive prototypes.

This project revisits a previous modeling attempt, the HotelManagementSystem project, to reflect on lessons learned and apply them in the HospitalCRM system analysis.

## Hotel Management System

The initial HotelManagementSystem project encountered challenges due to its high complexity and expansive scope. These challenges included:
- Managing model integrity.
- Implementing accurate OCL contracts.
- Validating intricate interdependencies.

This experience highlighted the need for an iterative, focused approach concentrating on essential features.

## HospitalCRM System Analysis and Validation

### Introduction

The HospitalCRM system is designed to enhance patient relationship management and care delivery across healthcare facilities. Its key capabilities include:
- Patient information and appointment management.
- Access to medical records and ensuring data security.
- Analytics for staff and feedback collection from patients.
- User-friendly tools and interfaces.

### Natural Language Requirements

The project documented major system functions using structured user stories. These stories follow a standard template covering stakeholders, needs, and benefits.

### UML Model

The UML model captures the operational aspects of the system:
- **Use Case Diagram:** Illustrates high-level user-system interactions through actors and their actions. For example, the "View Medical History" use case.
  // UPLOAD PHOTO
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Describe specific system operation flows. For example, the steps involved in appointment scheduling.
  // UPLOAD PHOTO
- **Class Diagram:** Defines the main real-world entities in the system and their relationships. For example, the association between Patient and Doctor classes with the Appointment class.
  // UPLOAD PHOTO
- **OCL Contracts:** Establish formal rules and constraints. For example, ensuring only authenticated users can access records.

### Prototype Generation


The use of RM2PT for automated prototype creation enabled the visualization of interactions and the validation of requirements. These prototypes facilitated the simulation of workflows.

## Conclusion

Despite its limitations, RM2PT effectively bridged the gap between theory and implementation, enhancing analytical competencies through practical application.
